Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today.  As I look back on the quarter, I am pleased with the results as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while continuing to maintain our focus on improved execution and cost management.  Our Devices and Consumer segment had a very good quarter, and grew 13% with a successful holiday.  Our Commercial segment had another great quarter and grew 10% to over $12 billion, as we continue to deliver on our differentiated cloud strategy.  We performed well this quarter, and you see it in our financial results.This holiday, we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One, which launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over 5 weeks.  According to NPD Group figures, Xbox One was the leading console in the US for the month of December, which was its first full month in market.  When adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the US market with 46% share in December.  We are excited by this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers, and are working to increase the availability of Xbox One.  With Surface, demand continued to grow benefiting from improved execution at retail and favorable reviews of the new Surface devices.  Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter, with customers recognizing Surface’s differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their life.  We feel good about the progress we have made over the past couple of quarters, and are enthusiastic about the overall opportunity ahead with Surface. The Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress.  Earlier this fall, we launched Windows 8.1 which enables smarter, faster and more personalized devices and our OEM partners are taking advantage of this.  Over the last few months, they’ve delivered a breadth of differentiated devices designed to meet a wide range of customer needs.  We’re encouraged by what we’ve been able to accomplish with our partners, and collectively we will continue to focus on driving the Windows ecosystem forward. Now let me share some perspectives on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our expectation.  Business PC’s grew again, for the third consecutive quarter, and benefitted from an improving macro environment, better availability of innovative new hardware, and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows XP end of support.  Additionally, growth was higher in large enterprises than small and medium sized businesses.  Consumer PC’s, while better than our expectations, continue to be soft as they face challenges from competing form factors.  And, as a general theme, developed markets outperformed emerging markets.Windows continues to be the platform of choice for business.  This quarter Windows Pro revenue grew 12% and outpaced the underlying business PC market.  This was driven by faster growth in both enterprises and developed markets where Pro attach is higher.  Windows non-Pro revenue however was down 20% reflecting the dynamics of the consumer PC market.   Now let’s move to our commercial business, where key metrics remained strong. Bookings grew 12% and renewal rates remained in line across our product portfolio, even with a large expiring base in the quarter.  Unearned revenue grew 12% and our contracted not billed balance is at a record level of over $23 billion.  To me, this is important, as these long-term commitments demonstrate the confidence that customers have in our product roadmap, where we are investing in key areas such as Big Data, infrastructure management and cloud computing.In Big Data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014 builds on the momentum we’ve established. Offering a complete business intelligence solution for Big Data, SQL Server is driving significant In-Memory performance gains.  Additionally, it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery as well as providing enhanced availability and security.   Hybrid infrastructure and management offerings also continue to be important priorities.  Windows Server, Azure and System Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy, and together they enable portability and scalability of workloads.  Using our suite of products, customers get high scale virtualization, built in software defined networking, and hybrid business continuity that enables their modern data centers.As CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs and deliver business agility, they are turning to our cloud services.  Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online offer customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud and benefit from enterprise-class features and a familiar user interface.  Additionally, Windows Azure provides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and platform needs.In summary, we had a very good quarter across our consumer and commercial business.  We are taking share with many products, and seeing improvements in areas where we needed to be better.  As we do this, we continue to prioritize the deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver products that our customers love.With that overview of the quarter, I’ll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance, before I come back and share thoughts on our outlook.	CHRIS SUH:  First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by reporting segment.We had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue in Q2.  Total revenue was up 11%, to $24.5 billion. And without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been higher by $196 million, or 1 percentage point.Cost of goods sold increased 46%.  This increase was primarily due to costs associated with the new Xbox and Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in cloud infrastructure supporting our consumer and commercial offerings. Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross margin was flat at $16.2 billion.Operating expenses grew 3%, which was below our guidance, as we continue to focus on prioritizing spend towards strategic growth initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4%, to $8.0 billion and $0.78 cents, respectively.   This quarter, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest amount in the last 12 quarters.I am now going to talk through performance in each of our reporting segments. In Our Devices and Consumer segment, revenue grew 13%.  Within this, the Licensing segment, which primarily includes Windows OEM, consumer Office, and Windows Phone, declined 6%, reflecting the overall PC and device market trends. We continue to see similar dynamics to the previous quarter. Total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%. As Amy described, the 12% growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro. Excluding the impact of China, where we continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro revenue declined 14%.  Office attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional Consumer Office licensing revenue declined 24%.  However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline was due to the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional consumer Office outperformed the underlying consumer PC market.Next, I will move on to our Hardware segment, where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68%, driven by a good holiday quarter for our consumer devices.  Xbox One had a record launch and together with Xbox 360, we shipped 7.4 million consoles.  For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT, and also introduced Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market.Moving to Devices and Consumer Other. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium, and other consumer products and services. Revenue in this segment declined 10% when compared to last year, when we launched Halo 4. Search advertising revenue grew 34%, driven by continued revenue per search improvements and query volume growth.  Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S.  Office 365 Home Premium adoption continues to be strong. With this service, customers are always running the most up-to-date version, have content available across their devices with SkyDrive integration and get free Skype minutes. The overall value proposition is resonating well with customers and we now have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter, it accounted for more than 15% of total consumer Office licenses sold. Turning now to our Commercial segment, all up Commercial revenue and gross margin, across both on-premise and cloud services, grew 10%.  The Commercial Licensing segment, which reflects our traditional software licensing, grew 7% and our Commercial Other segment, which captures our commercial cloud services as well as our enterprise services business, grew 28% to $1.8 billion.  As economies of scale benefits accrue to these online services, we are seeing gross margin expansion in our Commercial Other segment.   We saw continuing strength across our commercial portfolio.Server product revenue grew 12%. In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1 application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for System Center grew double digits, and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, gained 5 points of share over the last year. In our data platform business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market and revenue grew double-digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 25%.  Our Commercial Office products also remained strong, growing 10%.  Within this, our productivity server offerings SharePoint, Exchange and Lync continue to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We are excited about the unified communications opportunity, as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype to transform the communications experience.We are pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter, revenue for our Commercial Cloud services again grew over 100%, as customers of all sizes continued to leverage our cloud services to improve productivity, reduce costs and leverage a secure and trusted platform. We are seeing broad based adoption, as, Office 365 seats, Azure customers and Dynamics CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We now have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one of our cloud services. Having now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward looking guidance.  AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Chris.  Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia.  We continue to expect that the deal will close this quarter, but are still in the process of securing all regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions.  So, all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia.  Assuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macro environment to what we saw this quarter.  As such, many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third.  With that, let’s get into the outlook, starting with Devices and Consumer.  In Licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 to $4.3 billion.  This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the second quarter, with business PC’s growing, strong Pro mix and headwinds in consumer PC’s.  In Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 to $2.0 billion.  This reflects continued post launch momentum with Surface 2, Surface Pro 2, and Xbox One with the upcoming launch of Xbox exclusive, Titanfall. And in Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion. Moving on to Commercial, in what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue to be the vendor of choice with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.4 to $10.6 billion.  In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion, reflecting continued momentum in our commercial cloud business.We expect COGS to be $6.1 to $6.3 billion next quarter.  This range primarily reflects variability associated with our hardware business.Moving on to operating expenses.  We expect opex to grow 5% to 6%, to $7.7 to $7.8 billion.  We are also reducing and narrowing the range for our full year guidance to $31.2 to $31.5 billion. As a reminder, Other Income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.  We expect these items to generally offset one another.We still expect our full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million from our prior guidance.  This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale benefits as we converge our online services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the strong demand that we see in business.Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to sequentially decline as it has in prior years. So, in summary, I feel good about the financial results this quarter.  We are executing well across the company as demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, and we are also making important inroads with our consumer offerings.  Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about as we continue our transformation around One Microsoft.

AMY HOOD:  I really appreciate the question because it's going to let me help expand on a couple of dynamics, which I think are at work here.  So now I'm going to ask you to bear with me with a little bit of a long answer.

Let me start with your comment, I think, around the overall commercial licensing bucket, which I'm going to expand to include, as you did, the overall commercial business, both cloud and licensing.  There are a number of metrics that I tend to look at together as opposed to individually to think about how we did in the quarter.  You touched on one, unearned, which grew 12 percent this quarter, which is quite good.  The second is bookings, which grew 12 percent in this quarter, which is very good.  Renewal rates, which were in line across our products.  And finally the CNB balance, the contracted not billed balance being up sequentially $2 billion, as you point out, is very big.

If you think about those together as a group, those data points are very important because together I would say any    I think you said a couple hundred short on unearned.  With those data points together, I would say there's no shortage in terms of commercial licensing and commercial other strength all up.

As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be at the end of a quarter, great, we sign a bunch of contracts that we can't bill for until the very beginning of the next.  Think about that as business done in quarter.  You'll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in Q3 as well as into adjusted.  So that dynamic answers really the first question and a part of the question you asked.  So that's sort of a separate piece.

Then you said, well, some of the dynamic could be explained by some strong transactional business in the quarter.  I would say there's one place, and I would actually separate these things because the first was good, and the second was better than we thought.  The non-annuity or transactional did a little better than we thought in quarter as well, and so that's a good point that we didn't bring out, but that is another sort of component of the 10 percent all up commercial growth.

So I guess my answer is, I agree with your transactional comment, but I disagree that it's probably the overall    it's a component of a "shortfall" in unearned.  I would say both are actually quite good.


AMY HOOD:  Heather, thanks.  This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of a chunk.  First of all, I think if you look at our Commercial segment, I'll do it all up, because I actually think it's relatively easy with that breakdown.  In general, and you saw it this quarter, even as we continue to invest in the infrastructure to support our cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure, and Office 365 and CRM Online, our actual gross margin remained flat, which means we're increasing our utilization and growing gross margin in the commercial cloud business as we continue to see traction.

Over time I continue to believe our commercial business in the absolute, moving to the cloud is a net positive, as we talked about before, to overall profit, including increasing the amount of gross margin we make as a company.

So that I think this quarter was 83 percent-ish, so that I would take as a separate bucket from our devices and consumer business.  And now what's interesting is we have a couple of business models there with different gross margin profiles.  And you're actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter.

Xbox, as we know, especially with new consoles, like the One, tends to be gross margin negative on the front.  This was a heavy quarter for that.  Over time, for the attach, first, second, and third party games, and other services, the margin profile with any console life changes.  But, it's never going to be at 83 percent gross margin.  It's just a different business even for the market leader, and even successfully generating cash and return.

That is different from other businesses we also have in D&C.  So I think the important thing that I tend to focus on as I go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business, continued efficiency within the business, and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those areas, and then the mix then becomes more of a math equation, as we continue to grow the overall amount of cash and profit the company generates.

AMY HOOD:  Sure.  I covered it a little bit in my comments, but it's probably worth spending a little bit more time.  I apologize.  Let me start with the business market.  I think there really are three factors that I would point to, particularly in the business environment.  The first one may, Mark, also help on the consumer side.  The overall macro-spending environment is better.  It's a little better than we thought and in businesses we're seeing it, you're seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out.  They're being raised and I think that has an impact.

The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and availability of new and interesting hardware.  That brings people to the store and I think is an encouraging sign.

And finally, as you asked, is the end of life of XP.  That has been an impact and we expect it to continue to be, as we said in Q3.  But, I wouldn't point to simply one of the factors as being the reason, but it is a combination of those factors.

AMY HOOD:  Yes, that's right.  If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned.  Contracted but not billed is actually that the contract was signed, but because the billing won't take place until after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to unearned.

AMY HOOD:  Mark, that's actually    here's how I think about the value prop because I can't really say, these are sales through retail and through OEM generally, whether it's a net new user or not.  What I can say is that attach overall went up in the Office Consumer business, which I would say is and could be a sign that some of those are net new.  And I would hope that to be the case.  The value prop of Office 365 Home Premium really does expand the footprint.  It allows for multiple users.  It has cross-platform capabilities with Office for Mac.  It has mobile capabilities as well, and allows for easier trial.  So it does sort of lower many of the barriers to experience and try new products.  So while I can't point and say there's an exact number that is a new user, I can certain say with attach going up that dynamic is helpful.


AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Phil.  Let me    I'm going to take the opportunity to make your question two questions.  One is to talk about Windows Volume Licensing overall and secondly allow me to talk a little bit about the places that you can see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter and I think that will help as you think about Q3 going forward.

In volume licensing you're right, it did grow 10 percent in Q2 and we do believe we are seeing some of the benefit of that growth is the end of life of Windows XP.  But, it's also reflective of the value many of our bigger customers are seeing in upgrading to the enterprise version of Windows.  The enterprise SKU includes things like Direct Access, Windows To Go, the corporate image, App Locker, and those really are differentiating and they really do matter to many CIOs.

So I think specifically on VLs, while end of life of XP is one component, it's certainly not the only component.  Now, if I expand your question to sort of    and I think in a way John asked about it, too    I mean Mark asked about it, too, is the end of life of XP.

One place that we've talked about it was Windows and how does it play into the business PC growth.  The second we talked about was volume licensing.  And the third, which I actually talked about in John's question, was offsets and some transactional strengths.  Some of the strengths that we saw in Office transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP.  As people refresh a PC, and if they're buying Pro, those people often are Office customers.  And so if they tend to buy on a transactional basis they'd also see some impact through Office, I think you can tie that back to some of the out-performance we saw in the quarter, as well.


AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Walter.

When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that's the partnership, as you said, with retailers, with our OEMs, and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment, and the experience of buying in the PC aisle.  So I do feel good about the investment we've made there and we've made them I think thoughtfully and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do that.  So do I think it had an impact?  I do.  But, I really think the broader impact was investments and commitments we had with our partners to also improve the retail buying experience.

AMY HOOD:  Yes.  Yes and no, of course.  Brent, let me say, contracted but not billed is related to the number of expirations we have in the quarter.  Chris and, I think, I both talked about we did have a lot of expirations in the quarter.  When those tend to fall at the end it can impact the actual magnitude is the absolute number of expirations, and then the timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact how it's recognized.  And that's why I never really look at it separately from unearned, bookings, and renewals together.  And so, because timing is one thing, that's why I tend to put them in a bucket and say, together it's a good and healthy trajectory.

AMY HOOD:  I think in general it reflects the same trends we've been seeing.  It's across our broad portfolio.  You see it across Windows, Office, and Server.  If you look at our KPIs I think that points out that it's pretty broad-based.  So I don't think there's any one particular area I would call out.  It's really more about platform health and commitment.

AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Keith.  I'm glad you asked that question.  With our outperformance, as you pointed out, in D&C hardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that.  However, that was offset by some COGS improvement, and savings we saw across other areas as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution.  And so you're right, we did see COGS grow with hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as we focus on improved execution.

AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Kash.  The way I think about it is, we have a broad portfolio, and we address customers of all types, and in many ways our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers whether they be CIOs or consumers.  And setting our business model to support a product and the adoption curve that we want needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers.

I feel like we've done a very good job of balancing the pace of that.  I've been encouraged by the pace of adoption of many of our cloud services.  You heard the Home Premium numbers today as well as talking about the commercial cloud.  And so for me, it's hard to say, is there too big of a delta.  It's really about managing each of these things toward absolute growth and absolute improvement and having customer adoption.  So I probably just have a different perspective on that than you have.


AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Ed.  That's a good point, we didn't have a chance to discuss the phone results.  We did see growth in Windows Phone, both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues, both grew this quarter.  I think regarding Nokia, we continue to see the growth in many of the places we've seen it historically.  So unsubsidized markets as well as with entry level smart phone devices.  So I think many of those dynamics haven't really changed.

Do I have any updates to how to think about Nokia other than we continue to expect it to close in the quarter?  I don't.  We mostly remained focused on working hard to get to the point where we're working together as one team to drive that business forward.



AMY HOOD:  Rick, yes.  In many ways, you've seen this over covering our company for a while.  Expirations can be chunkier.  That's not a year statement.  This quarter we had a big expiry base.  I wouldn't characterize it as sort of abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to three years ago and the timing of some of the contracts.  So it's probably a consistent driver.

CHRIS SUH:  Hi, Rick.  It's Chris.  I think I talked about this a little bit.  The place where you can see the most direct impact is in the Consumer Office business.  We talked about the business on a traditional license basis being down 24 points.  But our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office 365 Home Premium.  So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the impact, the direct impact we're seeing particularly on the consumer side.

AMY HOOD:  Actually, that's a good question.  We only recently started selling the Office client in our volume licensing agreement through a subscription.  So that is actually good feedback for us to think going forward about talking about the Office specific business that way, because in general we think of Office 365 as being a broad set of assets including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Office in the Commercial business.  And we haven't really talked about it given the newness of the model in the enterprise as being as meaningful as it has been in the consumer.  The shift is far faster there on the client.

AMY HOOD:  Thanks.  Actually transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in quarter.  That's non-annuity.  It doesn't go to either the unearned balance or the contracted not billed balance.  So that's not an impact that results in a change to either unearned or CNB.  The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration date, frankly could or couldn't impact CNB.  It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can impact CNB depending on if it's contracted in quarter, but not billed until after the end of the quarter.

AMY HOOD:  Thanks, Brad.  When we launched Surface just a year ago our goal was really to create a product that showcased what can happen when you innovate in hardware, in the service, and in the software.  And as you know we've learned a lot over the course of this journey.  And we have to make more meaningful progress.  But, I think for us we've remained focused, as we launch the second version of Surface, to stay focused on both price point and gross margin.  And I think we've made a big leap from V1 to V2.  And I look forward to making leaps as we go forward in our product roadmap.  But, I do think it's more to think about it as a goal we absolutely have, as we continue to integrate the line.

AMY HOOD:  Thanks.  We'll continue to be in launch mode for Xbox One, especially as many people are excited about the launch of Titanfall in March, and we'll continue to add and expand markets over the course of the year.  So I would continue to think about our investment in being the leading next generation console as certainly extending.

AMY HOOD:  Thank you.  You're right.  I only pointed out a few of the value props of SQL Server.  And actually, dating back years the real value prop of SQL has been the breadth of its offerings, analytics, reporting, and core database functionality.  And so over the years I think the balance of those things, and continuing to add and innovate, at very good value, has continued to be appealing.

And as we move forward and add some cloud capabilities into our hybrid model, and continue to add features into the premium levels, when you're the established, and I think in many ways unit leader, then you can focus on continuing to move up the stack, adding value and increasing your premium mix.  And the team has really done a terrific job of doing that, so it's nice to be asked so that I can talk about it.

And I think I mentioned it briefly, but System Center is another where we've gained share in virtualization and I think we're quite proud of the progress we've made especially in that area, and that's enabled a lot of growth, as well.  So I actually appreciate the question.  It's good to be able to talk so positively about those assets.
