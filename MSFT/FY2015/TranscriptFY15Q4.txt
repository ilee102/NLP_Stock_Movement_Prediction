Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.SATYA NADELLA:Thank you Chris.  Good afternoon everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead. We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion in total revenue for fiscal year 15, an increase of eight percent year over year.We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investments in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large addressable markets.We galvanized around our mission, strategy, and ambitions.  We aligned our structure with our strategy to deliver better products at a more rapid pace.  We focused our advertising business on search.  We focused our mapping efforts on higher level experiences and developer services. We restructured our phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near-term while driving reinvention long term.  We invested more in new mobile applications like Wunderlist, Accompli and Sunrise.  We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen, and Bluestripe in this quarter alone.  And, we’re at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch.I’m proud of these steps.  And, I’m proud of the results we delivered in tandem.  In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year.  We’re on a strong trajectory toward our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 18. With that as a backdrop, I want to walk through the progress we’re making in each one of our three ambitions. Let me start with reinventing productivity and business processes including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics.  We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products.We now have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly one million per month.  In addition, we’ve surpassed 150 million downloads of Office mobile on iOS and Android, and have introduced a new version of Office for Mac.In the commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb with seats growing 74% year over year.  Office 365 is now in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, and more than 55% of the install base is on premium workloads.  It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud given half of all enterprise agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter. Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud.  In fact, for more than a year now we’ve seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month.Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 premium SKU for businesses, E5.  Now our customers will get rich new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN conferencing, deep analytics with Delve Org Analytics and Power BI Pro, and advanced security features such as Lockbox and Advanced Threat Protection.  With E5, we’ve expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion.  This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us. Let’s now turn to CRM.  This market alone is $20 billion plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering, sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way.  Last week we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering.This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM online increased 140% year over year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamics seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year over year.  This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business.Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure.   Again this quarter, we’re seeing proof that preference for our cloud SaaS services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services.In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits year over year.  We tripled our revenue from Azure Premium Services this quarter.  And, with Enterprise Mobility Services, we now have more than 17,000 customers.Appeal of our Visual Studio tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base with some of the decisions we made to embrace open source with .NET and support cross platform development.  Since November, we have seen more than five million downloads of Visual Studio Community, the fastest ever adoption of a Visual Studio product.  Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum with over 3.1 million registered users.Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion.  We are focused on strengthening our offerings in this space; just last week we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, a fully managed big data and advanced analytics solution.  We’re not only building the tools, but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses.Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers’ needs.  For example, we made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling our customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers can control.  We have four new certifications for Azure – bringing our certification and attestation total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today. Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices.I’m thrilled that we are just days away from the start of Windows 10.  It’s the first step toward our goal of one billion Windows 10 active devices in fiscal year 18.  Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from needing, to choosing, to loving Windows. Based on feedback from the more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation.  It’s safe, secure, and always up to date.  Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, Universal apps and Continuum.  And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences, like inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PCs, and also opens up entirely new device categories such as HoloLens. Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well.  Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work, and data protection.  It also provides a single mobile device management platform across all devices from phones, to laptops, to Internet-of-Things devices.  And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up to date with Windows Update for Business and Windows Store for Business.While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10.  In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrades, as well as hundreds of new hardware designs.  We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day.  And, by this holiday, we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.  Second, we’ll generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio.  We’ll also significantly reduce our losses on phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio.  Third, we’ll grow through monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer spaces.  In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management, security and servicing capabilities.  And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with Store, search and gaming. We’re confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth.  The progress we made this quarter and the forward looking guidance that Amy will share shows that the opportunity for renewed growth is real.  In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4.  We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue.  Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device.  Surface is clearly a product where we’ve gotten the formula right; earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of our hardware portfolio.Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10, and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch.  Xbox Live users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play.  Our growing fan base is excited for the best games line-up in our history.  All of this comes together with Windows 10 when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10 and experience the best virtual reality platform given our new partnerships with Oculus Rift and Valve.In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana, as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnerships we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple.  With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year.It’s been a strong year of progress.Above all else, I’m optimistic about our future.  Our cloud services are accelerating fast and Windows is positioned for renewed growth.  With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter’s results in more detail.  I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions.AMY HOOD:Thanks, and good afternoon everyone.Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we’ve made as a company over the past year.  Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first party hardware and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability.  Commercial customer renewals remained healthy, with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected.  And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned, while reducing the company’s operating expenses.  This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth where we feel we have unique competitive advantages.   With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance, before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results.  This quarter we recorded an impairment charge related to our Phone Hardware business, and incurred integration and restructuring expenses.  Additionally, like most multi-national companies, the strengthening of the US dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results.  Accordingly, when applicable, I will give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration and restructuring expenses, and also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals.Revenue was $22.2 billion, down five percent, and down two percent in constant currency.  As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia.  Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in D&C Licensing.  Total gross margin declined seven percent and three percent in constant currency.Operating income declined three percent and one percent in constant currency.  Earnings per share was $0.62 cents, growth of eleven percent, and growth of eight percent in constant currency.  Unearned revenue grew one percent to $25.3 billion, and seven percent in constant currency.  Commercial unearned revenue was better than expected as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter.  From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations.  The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on performance.  Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan and Brazil.   There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation. With that backdrop, I will move to a detailed discussion of our results.Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle.  It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing, as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within developed markets. This quarter, Pro revenue declined by 21% and similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP levels, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market.  The annuity portion of Windows volume licensing grew again on a constant currency basis, with non-annuity revenue declining due to XP.Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27% as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets.  In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week. Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth.  Overall Consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales.  Within D&C Licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points and the impact of Japan’s PC market accounted for another 19 points.  We had another impressive quarter in Search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search.  As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3.  Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter, and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers.  Our differentiated products, as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by over $450 million this quarter, and $1.3 billion in fiscal 15.Within Xbox, strong growth in consoles, online transactions and 1st party games, helped to drive revenue growth of 27%.  This progress, as well as the excitement that we generated at E3 with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility, demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem.  In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year’s full quarter sales.  ASPs however have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in Non-Lumia phones.  As announced on July 8th, we are changing our approach in this business, and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results.    Moving to our commercial results, total revenue across our two segments grew slightly in USD, and grew four percent in constant currency.  Our contracted not billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion, and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation of the US dollar.  Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year, though as a reminder, last year commercial bookings grew 23 percent on the strength of a larger renewal base as well as the end of XP discussed earlier.        Our Office commercial business continues to transition to Office 365.  We again grew the install seat base of Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business.  Office 365 allows us to have a deeper on-going relationship with all of our customers, which in turn provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time.Because of this transition, as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office Commercial products and services grew one percent in constant currency, which was similar to Q3.Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about, and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter.Server products and services grew four percent, and nine percent in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector.  SQL server share growth continues as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership.  Revenue and licenses of Windows server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market.  And in the public cloud space, we had another quarter of significant Azure usage growth.  Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our Commercial Other segment – increasing 13 points to over 43%.Moving to operating expenses, which declined nine percent, or four percent in constant currency. Our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base. Other income was favorable to our expectation driven by gains on foreign currency and sales of investments.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, and was at the high end of our guided range due in part to strong performance in our Computing and Gaming Hardware segment in the US.  We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year. With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments. As we have communicated over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally 2 to 4 years.  As shared previously, the initial deferral and subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corp and Other in our segment reporting.  Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won‘t change.  Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of the business health. With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal 16.  The strengthening of the US dollar will continue to have a significant impact on our results over the course of FY16, assuming rates across our largest currencies, the euro,  Japanese yen and the British pound stay in line with current rates, and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted.  In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is all recognized in quarter.  In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet.  In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by five points in each quarter of H1, with seven points of negative impact in our commercial segments.  H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds, and in H2, we expect FX to have three points of negative impact in total, and roughly four points negative on our commercial revenue.  With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year as we and our partners bring new devices, applications and services to market.  We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year.With the strength in Xbox and Xbox Live, along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability.With the recently announced changes in Phone, there will be significant revenue declines year-over-year in the phone segment each quarter.  With the proactive measures we’ve taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year.  We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete.Bing will be profitable in fiscal 16.Assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect that our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud.  We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018.We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lowered guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first party hardware efforts as well as sales headcount to accelerate our leadership position in Commercial Cloud.We expect our full year tax rate to be 24% plus or minus one point excluding the net impact from Windows 10 revenue deferrals.Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer.In Licensing, we expect revenue to be $3.4 to $3.6 billion.  This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market.  Within consumer Office, we expect the transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue.  In Computing and Gaming Hardware, we expect revenue to be $2.0 to $2.1 billion.  As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, reflecting our change in approach.  We expect gross margin in Phone to improve sequentially in Q1.  In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, consumer Office 365 and Xbox Live transactions.  And in Commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter.  Our constant currency growth is expected to be about seven percent in Q1 which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered.  With the negative impact of FX we expect revenue to be roughly flat.  In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 to $9.2 billion with a continued shift to annuity.  And in Commercial Other, with the significant growth in our Commercial Cloud, revenue of $3.1 to $3.2 billion.We expect COGS to be $7.0 to $7.2 billion, with variability being driven by both hardware segments.  We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 to $7.7 billion.  As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.  Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase, and other income and expense to be negative $200 million.Excluding the Windows 10 deferral and impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned revenue to be slightly better than historic seasonality driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue. In closing, I am proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our Company has made over this past year.  We’ve improved how we operate in virtually every sense.  These changes have allowed us to aggressively invest in areas that will drive future growth for the company.  And looking forward, we are better positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.SATYA NADELLA:  Yes, I'll take that.  Over all, we're very excited about the growth we're seeing in Office 365.  On the consumer side, as you noted, we're growing a million subs a month and that's fantastic growth for us.  The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all is present has also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have this subscription relationship with us.
On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us.  And the growth comes in multiple forms.  It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365.  It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5, that's the commitment we're seeing.
And we also see small businesses, I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small and medium sized businesses, each month signing up for Office 365.  That's pretty unprecedented, having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well.
And that cloud revenue number that is the 88 percent is all up cloud revenue.  It's inclusive of Office 365, EMS and Azure.  And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.
AMY HOOD:  And the one thing I would add to that is an important dynamic that we're seeing in Office 365 is as we are having this momentum build, and Satya has talked about some of the new customers we're adding, and the way we see that is the install base growing.  And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office.
And when you think about why that's so critical long-term, it's our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches.  They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services.  So when you can both add to your install base and add our overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.
SATYA NADELLA:  Yes, overall I start even with the world view that my server business is not some legacy business.  We fundamentally think of our servers as the extension of the cloud.  I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud.  Every server, for example, has things like disaster recovery, backup and tiering with the cloud.  So we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique.
And you see it in the numbers.  Our servers, even this quarter, grew 9 percent, and compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share in Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well.
And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on premise deployment.  So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud.  We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud.  But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave.  I'm excited about our SQL product.  I think it goes into the first preview next -- in fact tomorrow.  And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product, because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and even tier it with the cloud.  And that kind of capability only we can provide.  And that's something that I'm looking forward to. 
AMY HOOD:  And, Brent, to your specific question on Windows Server 2003, we did have a good quarter as we talked about in Windows Server.  But in general that business, unlike the client upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release.  That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher value prop and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.
AMY HOOD:  Well, why don't I take that one and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is.  You know, at 9 percent growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be sort of a positive outlier to the peer group.  And for me that type of performance and double digits for the year I still feel quite good about.
In general what's interesting, I think, is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud?  We continue to see that.  The very best example frankly Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, the Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings.  It's taking something that's very unique, builds off of our core in the server business, and allows us to both grow and add new perspectives there.  So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter.
Also, if you'll remember, a year ago we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago.  So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.
SATYA NADELLA:  Yes.  The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, this is -- there are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all, even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management.  But we now have management, data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting, and that growth is great to see.
The same thing on the server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on premise units.  Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all in spite of all the success we had in the database business.

So I'm excited about building new workloads that in many cases are born in the cloud workloads where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to out-perform our peers and grab share when it comes to on premises.
SATYA NADELLA:  Yes, I'll take that, and Amy you can add to it.
The way the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it.  In fact, if anything this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program; everything is, of course, speeding up, because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows as a service, even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us.  But that said there are three distinct phases.
The first phase is what I'll describe as the upgrade phase, that's what starts in a week's time.  And that is more retail execution and upgrades.  Then come the fall you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter.  And then the enterprise upgrades, in fact, we have a release of enterprise features which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that timeframe and I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year.
So that's how I'll think about the OEM, as well as enterprise adoption.  So I would -- my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year.  And of course it will build.  It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I sort of see this in three phases.
AMY HOOD:  And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean.  This is a healthy state.  It's been in the range of normal.  So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it.  It is pretty standard, as Satya talked about, in terms of the dynamic.  And he mentioned we are feeling I think a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come.  So I don't really think of it in that way.  I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.
SATYA NADELLA:  Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to it.  The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation.  That's perhaps the biggest shift, because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety.  We clearly are going to have a premium first party portfolio.  And you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface.  I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories, all of that is what I want to do broadly and it applies to phones, it applies to Surface Hub, it applies to HoloLens.  And that's how I view it.
I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself, so Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we're going to focus on it.  We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows fans.  That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices and we hope to change that with Windows 10.
We have, in fact, good traction in the business segment.  So this is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with essentially a smart phone to be able to deploy their line of business applications.  That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have the Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about.  So you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course management and security.  So that's the place where we want to continue to focus.
And in the value smart phones, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient.  We clearly have some value to add there, because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services.  But, at the same time I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many -- which price points we want to participate, that's where you will see the most significant operational changes form how we operated last year to the coming year.
AMY HOOD:  And so, Keith, the way I think about that, I tried to outline it in my comments, is that the significant revenue declines, quarter-over-quarter for the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone.  It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us.  Our profitability will also improve.  More of that comes in the second half of the year, structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rates.  But, I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you would expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.

SATYA NADELLA:  In fact, we are adding significant value in security.  It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities around O365 in security and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we just announced called E5, the secure Lock Box.  That's actually a pretty -- very cool set of features that allows both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit-ability and control over their movement to the cloud.  Similarly Azure, while we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys, so those are all security features.  We bought a company called Aorato that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management.  So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth.
So the approach we're taking is we are essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are.  So it's more than just launching one point security product.  It's much more broadly participating in the security market and you've seen some of that in the inorganic move, and the suites we have created.
AMY HOOD:  I do think over the long term you're right, that is how I think about it, and frankly inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given that is sort of implied, to your point.  And so I think 100 percent is not the logical answer.  There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it.  But, I do think over time we do expect the trend in that general direction. 
SATYA NADELLA:  I mean overall business process collaborations, communications, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change.  I've always felt that in some sense most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools and this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of sort of how do we go solve and CRM has taken our own Dynamics product has taken some pretty unique approaches and quite frankly I also want to open up our communication and collaborations for other CRM vendors.

One of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications, because this is a very fragmented market world over, especially if you add SMB.  And so we want to be having a platform play, as well as our own business applications play and both of them should be high growth for us.
And in the last year we've just added more focus, and we've put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now of course I've mainstreamed it across Microsoft, because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add as opposed to driving our own top line/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation.  And that is what is exciting to see.
And it's not just CRM.  I'm actually excited about our ERP business, some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats.  And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data, which all will move to the cloud.  And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform.  So in fact that's one of the reasons why I'm even sort of very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities is we have the attach capability to our even install base of Dynamics.
AMY HOOD:  And, Walter, just quickly, this is one of the areas that we invested in actually leading into this past fiscal year, FY '15, and the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment.  So I think we both feel very good about the momentum that's built through the year.
AMY HOOD:  Sure, Karl.  Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit.  We out-performed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that does -- took us a little bit outside the COGS range, but not as much as our revenue out-performed.  So actually margins structurally were better than I thought they would be.  And so I actually feel quite good with that out-performance, and our ability to see that out-performance fall to the bottom line though stronger execution on gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.
SATYA NADELLA:  At this point I would say it's pretty broad even use cases for even enterprise customers.  There's definitely dev test happening.  There is production IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service, deployment given some of the new high performance SKUs and storage options that we have.  And we're seeing significant adoption of SQL, so this is Azure DB, machine learning as a service.
One of the things that we realized is that every company out there becomes a software company beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company.  They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning.  And that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities, so that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption.
We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends or back ends for new front ends.  So essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their Web.  That's another use case that's high growth for us.  And, of course, Cortana Analytics.  This is the big data side of it.  This is happening in IT.  It's happening in, as I said, these digital offices within each one of the customers.
So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases that some of the customers have talked about even in the recent set of conferences from our partner conference to our Ignite Conference.  We've been, in fact, showcasing even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.
SATYA NADELLA:  Sure.  On the IaaS with the PaaS, it's an interesting question.  I've not looked at it in isolation, because what happens is at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our Media Services for, for example, just doing content encoding.  So there's a mix always.  So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS.  That's the trend I see.  But it's a split that we should go take a look at and then offline maybe even talk about it.

But overall we've seen a significant amount of IaaS in the last year, because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness which we have now overcome.  So we are seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise.  But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS.  And that I think is the mix on it.
And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity.  Having sort of worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented.  I think people like to talk about leaders, and there are clearly leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers in segments.  But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals, and then the platform effects.  There's plenty of opportunity.
For sure you've got to be one of the players.  It will be three players, four players, whatever.  But in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them.  We already have a $2-plus billion Dynamics business.  I talked about the total number of seats.  And now we have this triple digit CRM Online growth.  So I feel that we are in a good position, and I feel that things like we'll look at, and even some of the inorganic means to keep growing it.  In fact, the FieldOne Systems acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that.  So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects. 
 
AMY HOOD:  Sure, I talked a little bit about it. But let me go into a bit of detail on that.  I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 to $32.4 full year OPEX guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does.  And so what you can then see, as relates to the second half of your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen.
I outlined three on the call.  The third one I probably could have expanded more on.  The first one is Windows 10.  The second is the first party hardware where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4.  And then, finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our commercial cloud leads.  And I do feel like in that area we could invest in Office 365 some of the new E5 capabilities.  I look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that.  We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly.
And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.

SATYA NADELLA:  And one thing I'll just add, because a lot of folks even asked about our business process and business application, I want to build a long-term profitable business.  In other words, one of the keys in biz apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all.
One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term profitable business.  That's at front and center to me.  So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing, because we do believe the products -- in fact, there's a different way to sell even business process applications, because of the cloud and that's something that we want to take advantage of.
AMY HOOD:  Great.  You know, I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, it did occur again this quarter.  So I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed and the projections.  I do continue to expect that to happen as we shared back that last week in April.
And on the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right, generically each of those examples was quite different.  There were people that were upgrading from X to Y.  There were people that were just simply moving to the cloud.  But, one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunities, build value, and deploy it more quickly to customers.
And generally I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question.  I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margins.  So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criterion of that.  So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.

SATYA NADELLA:  Overall, Dan, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth and in there Amy alluded to this.  We have made significant changes in how we have allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D, as well as in sales and marketing.  And we'll continue to do that, because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after and that will require us to just reallocate aggressively and that to me is core.
But, beyond that we will look at inorganic means.  When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of the last year and our OPEX guidance for next year, shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing.  So we are not afraid to bring in new capabilities, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have.
Of course, you know, we have done smaller acquisitions.  But, they add up.  They are pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all the things that we have done in the Azure space.  So we'll continue to do that.  And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OPEX basis, post acquisition, we will look at that.  So I won't shy away from it, because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.
